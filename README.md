# Reversi

To play the game, run the `Reversi.py` file. You need to have pygame and pygame installed.

The code allows you to play Reversi/Othello locally or against a MinMax bot. You can choose the depth and color for the bot.

The MinMax stays quick due to alpha-beta pruning and a transposition table.
